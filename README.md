# InfoSec-Notes

This repo will contain every note I make related to information secrutiy. I have been an enthusiast for over two years,
and after having a late night rm -Rf frenzy on my machine I accidentally deleted the folder containing every single note
I had made in those years.

As I explained in my blog post here http://oleaass.com/my-journey-through-2015/, I will start documenting everything on my
blog and here! I will aim for one blog post each day explaining what I have learned that day. No matter how noob, shitty,
crappy, whatever you might think it is. I will post it. Some will laugh, others wonâ€™t care and some might learn something.
